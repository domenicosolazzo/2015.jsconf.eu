  - Presentation: [I Think I Know What You’re Talking About, But I’m Not Sure](https://github.com/jennz0r/think-know-not-sure)
  - Description: "Recursion, instantiate, lexical scope - where do these words come from?! If you’ve ever been in conversation with other developers and thought, “I think I know what they’re talking about, but I’m not sure…”, you’re not alone. Let’s delve into the weird and wonderful parlance that computer scientists and developers have created for themselves. Whether the words are borrowed or just plain made up, I’ll uncover how they made their way into the vocabulary of the modern programmer. 
In this session, you’ll learn everything from etymology to history to broader definitions, all of which can help you understand what the heck that person’s rambling about. So, the next time you’re in conversation, you’ll be the one discussing dependency injection versus inversion of control with ease."

  - Presentation: [So how does the browser actually render a website](#)
  - Description: "We all take for granted that when we push enter in the browsers address bar, magic happens. The browser gets our HTML, that intern requests all the dependencies, insert magic, other things happen and then we have our site rendered. Simple, right, right… Like many people as I’ve progressed in my career, building for the web, I’ve become curious as to how the browser does what it does. What makes it tick, how it turns a string of HTML into a data structure, how CSS & JavaScript come into play. Things like render tree, style recalculation, paints, reflows, all alien words will start to make sense by the end of this talk.
Suddenly you’ll understand why people recommend you place script tags at the bottom of the document, inlining critical CSS & all sorts of other performance techniques."

  - Presentation: [What it’s like to live on the Edge](#)
  - Description: "This is the story of a new browser with a complicated legacy. It’s a story about making new friends without alienating old acquaintances. Most of all, it’s a story about innovating without breaking the Web. This is the story of Microsoft Edge, the new browser in Windows 10, how it came to be, what separates it from Internet Explorer and what that means for web developers. It’s a tale of epic proportions with a happy ending that is really only the beginning."

- [Etiene Dalcol](#)( [Twitter](https://twitter.com/etiene_d) / [Github](https://github.com/Etiene) / [Website](http://etiene.net/) )
  - Presentation: [What I learned teaching programming to 150 beginners](#)
  - Description: "A few months ago I was invited to give a workshop at Women’s International Leadership Conference on Introduction to Programming. That was an amazing experience that taught me incredible things and motivated me to open source all the steps. "

- [Sam Richard](#)( [Twitter](https://twitter.com/snugug) / [Github](https://github.com/Snugug) / [Website](http://snugug.com/) )
  - Presentation: [Domo Arigato Mr. Roboto](https://github.com/Snugug/mr-roboto)
  - Description: "How would your message change if your email client told you your phrasing is likely to be perceived as negative? What would you cook if you could explore ingredient and culinary style pairings you’ve never encountered? How could your research improve if answers came with confidence levels and supporting evidence you can explore?
Welcome to the world of Cognitive Computing, the next wave of computing technology bridging the gap between computers and humans. While these possibilities may seem far off, you can build all of these today! Let’s explore."

- [Stephan Bönnemann](#)( [Twitter](https://twitter.com/boennemann) / [Github](https://github.com/boennemann/) / [Website](http://boennemann.me/) )
  - Presentation: [Dependency Hell Just Froze Over](http://greenkeeper.io/)
  - Description: "If extensive libraries and even the tiniest module followed [SemVer](http://semver.org/) strictly, dependency hell would be a thing of the past … but humans weren’t made to follow rules.
There are way more than 150.000 packages on npm today – the most of any registry. Using the right packages in your own modules and applications makes JavaScript the joy to develop it is today. But if even immensely popular libraries fail to properly declare breaking changes, how can we trust the over 50.000 strangers who developed all these modules? Currently we can’t. Let me show you how to write confidence-inspiring modules with breaking change detection and fully automated, tested releases including changelogs. Machines do a way better job with this than buggy humans."

- [Denys Mishunov](#)( [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mishunov) / [Github](https://github.com/mishunov) / [Website](http://mishunov.me/) )
  - Presentation: [Illusion of Time. When 60 seconds is not 1 minute](http://www.slideshare.net/spliter/illusion-of-time-when-60-seconds-is-not-1-minute)
  - Description: "What is common for Walt Disney World, airports and magicians? All of these are distorting user’s perception to build illusions that make us feel good even though we don’t notice them so easily. Those are time illusions. Developers, as magicians, can use the same techniques to distort users’ perception of time to deliver fast and competitive products. The talk is about psychology, perception, time and, of course, illusions."

- [Nick Hehr](#)( [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hipsterbrown) / [Github](https://github.com/hipsterbrown) / [Website](http://hipsterbrown.com/) )
  - Presentation: [The Other Side of Empathy](#)
  - Description: "In an industry that is so focused frameworks & tooling, we tend to lose sight of the people behind the products and how we work with them. I’ve found empathy to be a powerful resource while collaborating with teams inside companies and across the open source community. By breaking down The Other Side of Empathy, I will demonstrate how applying its principles to your development process will benefit the community and the products they create."

  - Presentation: [Salvaging contentEditable: Building a Robust WYSIWYM Editor](#)
  - Description: "Web-based WYSIWYG editors are notorious for spitting out a distasteful HTML soup. In this talk I’ll show how I implemented an editor that, instead of trying to filter and clean this soup, takes control away from the browser’s contentEditable implementation, and reinterpret user actions as operations on our own semantic document model (i.e. not HTML). The result is a WYSIWYM (what you see is what you mean) editor, more predictable than classic WYSIWYG, and just as user friendly."

- [Sarah Meyer](#)( [Twitter](https://twitter.com/meyerini) / [Github](https://github.com/sarahmeyer) )
  - Presentation: [Life in the Wilderness: How to Pioneer Tech Culture](#)
  - Description: "A lot of us are engineers at companies that don’t enshrine technology as their core product, or that employ significantly more non-technical than technical people. Others of us work completely alone as freelancers. If you’re in that position, how do you create a place for technological transformation in the organization, or communicate with non-technical clients? I’ll cover how to - evaluate what your project needs - maintain your productivity - create understanding of technical issues - keep learning without anyone around to teach you new stuff."

- [Peter Müller](#)( [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_munter_) / [Github](https://github.com/Munter) / [Website](https://mntr.dk/) )
  - Presentation: [Transpiling Recomposed](#)
  - Description: "Modern web developers have become heavily dependent on abstractions like jade, sass or ES6. These are powerful tools, but to themselves require new abstractions, wrappers and runners. The rate at which new tools, workflows and even languages are appearing is staggering. Each iteration adds more complexity and less interoperability.
So how do we expect newcomers to be able to enter our field when we can hardly keep up ourself?
This will be an exploration of our tool chains with a focus on transpilers. The mission: To identify moving parts, recompose and simplify for the good of the current and future generation of developers."

  - Presentation: [Breaking Bad - Web Components in production, what worked for us](#)
  - Description: "Imagine many teams distributed over the globe working on different services. Each team is small enough to be fed with two large pizzas. Got that? Welcome to AWS! This is what makes us successful, but it also brings its own challenges. One of them is ensuring accessibility, performance, and consistency across all our UIs. Because of this we chose to explore Web Components in the last year and I want to share what we have learned. I will go over the current state and support of all Web Components building blocks. It will get technical fast as I tell you why polyfills did not work for us. We continued to investigate the underlying technology and wrote our own library that I want to share with you. As no goal can be achieved by ‘only’ producing code, I will also explain what I did in addition."

- [Joa Ebert](#)( [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joa) / [Github](https://github.com/joa/) / [Website](https://www.joa-ebert.com/) )
  - Presentation: [JVM/JS](#)
  - Description: "Compiling Java bytecode to JavaScript is an interesting problem to solve and many things can be learned from this challenge. 1) The difference of JSVMs and performance implications. 2) The state of WebIDL and why it matters. 3)Types and optimizing compilers: an AOT love story. Technology is always just a means to an end. That’s why we’ll also look at self-optimizing display lists, WebGL and the WebAudio API in real-world apps."

- [Szymon Nowak](#)( [Twitter](https://twitter.com/szimek) / [Github](https://github.com/szimek) )
  - Presentation: [How to grow your own Babel fish](#)
  - Description: "In “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” the Babel fish is an animal, which “if you stick one in your ear, you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language”. In this talk I’ll show you how easy it is to write a web app that does exactly that. I’ll also discuss some of the current Web Speech API limitations that hopefully will be removed in the near future to make the web even more powerful platform for real-time communication. And you won’t have to stick anything into your ear!"

- [Dmitry Baranovskiy](#)( [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DmitryBaranovsk) / [Github](https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy) / [Website](http://dmitry.baranovskiy.com/) )
  - Presentation: [Zen of JavaScript](#)
  - Description: "Long time passed since JavaScript become mainstream. And despite multiple attempts, there is still no right single way to write code in this language. Everybody is using it in their own special way and most people still fill that they are failing to tame the language. In this talk I will try to show you what language is trying to tell us for all these years, where is real path to enlightenment or at least we could have fun and look at things we know (or pretending to ;) from unorthodox point of view."
