  - Presentation: [I Think I Know What You’re Talking About, But I’m Not Sure](https://github.com/jennz0r/think-know-not-sure)
  - Description: "Recursion, instantiate, lexical scope - where do these words come from?! If you’ve ever been in conversation with other developers and thought, “I think I know what they’re talking about, but I’m not sure…”, you’re not alone. Let’s delve into the weird and wonderful parlance that computer scientists and developers have created for themselves. Whether the words are borrowed or just plain made up, I’ll uncover how they made their way into the vocabulary of the modern programmer. 
In this session, you’ll learn everything from etymology to history to broader definitions, all of which can help you understand what the heck that person’s rambling about. So, the next time you’re in conversation, you’ll be the one discussing dependency injection versus inversion of control with ease."

  - Presentation: [So how does the browser actually render a website](#)
  - Description: "We all take for granted that when we push enter in the browsers address bar, magic happens. The browser gets our HTML, that intern requests all the dependencies, insert magic, other things happen and then we have our site rendered. Simple, right, right… Like many people as I’ve progressed in my career, building for the web, I’ve become curious as to how the browser does what it does. What makes it tick, how it turns a string of HTML into a data structure, how CSS & JavaScript come into play. Things like render tree, style recalculation, paints, reflows, all alien words will start to make sense by the end of this talk.
Suddenly you’ll understand why people recommend you place script tags at the bottom of the document, inlining critical CSS & all sorts of other performance techniques."

  - Presentation: [What it’s like to live on the Edge](#)
  - Description: "This is the story of a new browser with a complicated legacy. It’s a story about making new friends without alienating old acquaintances. Most of all, it’s a story about innovating without breaking the Web. This is the story of Microsoft Edge, the new browser in Windows 10, how it came to be, what separates it from Internet Explorer and what that means for web developers. It’s a tale of epic proportions with a happy ending that is really only the beginning."

  - Presentation: [What I learned teaching programming to 150 beginners](#)
  - Description: "A few months ago I was invited to give a workshop at Women’s International Leadership Conference on Introduction to Programming. That was an amazing experience that taught me incredible things and motivated me to open source all the steps. "

  - Presentation: [Domo Arigato Mr. Roboto](https://github.com/Snugug/mr-roboto)
  - Description: "How would your message change if your email client told you your phrasing is likely to be perceived as negative? What would you cook if you could explore ingredient and culinary style pairings you’ve never encountered? How could your research improve if answers came with confidence levels and supporting evidence you can explore?
Welcome to the world of Cognitive Computing, the next wave of computing technology bridging the gap between computers and humans. While these possibilities may seem far off, you can build all of these today! Let’s explore."

  - Presentation: [Dependency Hell Just Froze Over](http://greenkeeper.io/)
  - Description: "If extensive libraries and even the tiniest module followed [SemVer](http://semver.org/) strictly, dependency hell would be a thing of the past … but humans weren’t made to follow rules.
There are way more than 150.000 packages on npm today – the most of any registry. Using the right packages in your own modules and applications makes JavaScript the joy to develop it is today. But if even immensely popular libraries fail to properly declare breaking changes, how can we trust the over 50.000 strangers who developed all these modules? Currently we can’t. Let me show you how to write confidence-inspiring modules with breaking change detection and fully automated, tested releases including changelogs. Machines do a way better job with this than buggy humans."

## Tools
- [Semver](http://semver.org/): Semantic Versioning
- [Greenkeeper.io](http://greenkeeper.io/): Always up-to-date npm dependencies, zero hassle
